## Module description - 2023

In this lecture, we provide an overview of blockchain systems and systems engineering, focusing on the technical details and applications of blockchain systems. We introduce cryptographic hash functions and present their properties. Then the data structure and the working principles of the Bitcoin blockchain are investigated in detail. We analyze permissionless consensus and Sybil control mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (PoW) of Bitcoin and illustrate the mining scheme. Moreover, we inspect the risks, challenges, and limitations of the technology. Following this, we demonstrate the system architecture of the Ethereum blockchain with a focus on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and smart contracts. Subsequently, the Solidity language is explained in terms of syntax, types, and design. Ethereum decentralized applications (dApps) are illustrated with current standards and frameworks, and specifics to dApp developments are introduced. The Tezos blockchain is introduced with a focus on its advanced infrastructure, consensus mechanism, on-chain governance, and use cases. Alternative approaches to distributed ledger technologies in the enterprise space are also discussed. Accordingly, the Hyperledger project and the framework Fabric are unfolded. Further, we present an overview of the current state of the blockchain ecosystem with a focus on topics such as Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) & Decentralized Identity Management, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Automated Market Makers (AMM), Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), and an upcoming blockchain, Algorand.
